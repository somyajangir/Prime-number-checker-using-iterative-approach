# Prime-number-checker-using-iterative-approach
Overview
This C++ program checks if a given integer n is a prime number using an iterative approach.

How It Works
Input: The program takes an integer n as input from the user.
Conditions:
If n is 0 or 1, it immediately concludes that n is not a prime number.
If n is negative, it states that negative numbers are not considered prime.
For other positive integers, it iteratively checks divisibility from 2 up to n-1.
Iteration: It iterates through numbers from 2 to n-1. If n is divisible by any of these numbers, n is determined not to be prime.
Output: Finally, based on the findings, it outputs whether n is a prime number or not.
Usage
Run the program and input an integer n.
The program will print whether n is a prime number or not.
