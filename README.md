# Prime-number-checker-using-iterative-approach
Prime Number Checker: This program checks if a number you enter is a prime number (a number divisible only by 1 and itself). It uses a simple method of checking divisibility by numbers from 2 up to the number itself minus one. If the number can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself, it's considered a prime number; otherwise, it's not.
